# Phys-321-Project

Description of the problem: 
We applied an ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data in order to sample the posterior probability distributions of cosmological parameters (including Hubble constant, cosmological curvature, dark energy and cold dark matter fractions). We compared the probability distributions obtained from the two different data sets. We also implemented a correlated errors model for the CMB data, although due to slow run-time and our limited computing time for this project we were unable to run the MCMC with this model and investigate the results.


Contributions:

Ingrid: Helped trouble shoot the convergence of the MCMC, ran and generated all the plots for the lab. Wrote intro for LambdaCDM. Wrote the results, discussion as well as all the figure captions. Created table 1 of the final results. 

Noah: Wrote prior, likelihood, and posterior functions, covariance model using correlated & uncorrelated errors, functions for plotting WMAP and SNe fits as well as animation of the fit. Wrote & ran testing functions, wrote function I/O header comments. Wrote report sections 2.4, 3.1, bibliography, and helped edit the paper.
