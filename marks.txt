Final Project Marks
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
Clear description of your problem: 5/5
Approach to your problem: 10/10
Technical execution: 25/25
---Really nice touch with the automatic convergence testing!

Documentation and testing: 5/5
---Superbly well-documented code
---Reasonable effort with automated tests

Presentation of results: 5/5

Interpretation of results: 10/10
---The diagnosis of the CMB problems being due to a lack
of a preference for H_0 is right on. I still remember when
I was in grad school and presented a paper that had large
error bars on H_0 from WMAP, and Paul Schechter (of Schechter
Luminosity Function fame) said "that's right! The CMB alone
has terrible error bars when it comes to H_0. The fact that
people think the CMB can measure H_0 well is a MYTH PROPAGATED
BY PRINCETON UNIVERSITY!" These days it's a little better
because higher order effects in the CMB can break the
degeneracy you're seeing here. If you want to dig a little
bit into the degerenacy between Omega_k and H_0, look up
the "geometric degeneracy" of the CMB. This is why most CMB
papers *assume* that Omega_k = 0 when they do their fits.

Creativity + critical thinking: 10/10
---Nice use of animations!
---Good comparisons with literature

Overall communication: 5/5

TOTAL: 75/75

General comments
----------------------------------------
It's a shame there wasn't enough time to see the full
richness of the correlated errors, but that's ok! I imagine
the three of you are almost done with your last finals
as undergrads (if you're not already done). Congratulations
and best of luck with what's next!
